	<h1>System Evaluation: The National Archives Access to Archival Databases (AAD)</h1>
	<p>This site includes a system evaluation of the <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/" target="_blank">The National Archives Access to Archival Databases (AAD)</a> site. Created by Stephanie Davis – all information about the site presented here is information from the site’s user guides, which can be found under the “Getting Started Guide” on the site homepage.</p>

	<h2>System Introduction</h2>
	
	<h3>Context</h3>
	<p><a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/" target="_blank">The National Archives Access to Archival Databases (AAD)</a> site was created by the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/" target="_blank">National Archives</a> to exhibit a small portion of the archival material stored at the National Archives, therefore most records are missing and the site does not contain scanned material or photos. This material was sent from over 40 government agencies to the archives for permanent storage. Records consisting of the personal information of any living people or anything restricted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) are redacted where appropriate. This site is open to the public for research purposes and does not require an account or specialized access. Because the archival records are displayed in the state in which they were sent to the National Archives, there may be errors within the records and these errors have not been highlighted or fixed, this is to preserve the historical integrity of the records.</p>

	<h3>Users</h3>
	<p>The AAD site and the records it offers would be primarily of interest for use as research material. But because the site is open access, its target audience falls into two main groups: academics who use the site for historical research purposes to create a scholarly output or to complete an assignment, or casual visitors (academic or otherwise) without a predefined output in mind who have an interest in American history or the holdings of the National Archives.</p>
	<p>Casual visitors will find ample use for the “What’s New?”, “AAD Highlights”, and “Most Popular” sections of the homepage. Here they can view the most recent records added by the National Archives, records highlighted by the archival team with a short description of what they contain, and the records that other users are exploring. They also have the option of browsing archival records by category (e.g. Cold war, Sailors, Federal aid). These features facilitate exploration and the serendipitous discovery of hidden aspects of American history and promote further browsing.</p>
	<p>Academic researchers who are searching the AAD site for historical research to produce a specific scholarly output can utilize the predefined subjects to target their area of research. They can then use the “Index Terms” section of each series to enhance their search by picking specific search terms and using the advanced search feature to search for these terms so that they can find the records that fit their research. Though researchers should note the comment in the “Getting Started Guide” about possible logical and clerical errors in the records and include this disclaimer in their outputs.</p>


	<h3>Content</h3>
	<p>The AAD site only contains a very small subset of electronic records held by the National Archives, which still accounts for over 247 million records. Entries to the site are arranged as series, files, and records. A series is a collection of documents related by their accession, or some other relation, under which they were provided to the National Archives. A file is a specific database of records under a series where the records are all related under a single theme. A record is a single information resource within a file. Entries are all related to historical records from government agencies and span over fifty subjects. Because of the wide variety of data held in archival records, record data fields are not uniform. One file of technical personnel will store information on family name, first name, employment speciality, and education, and another file on air combat activities will store information on mission date, country of origin, province code, and mission primary function. Regardless, each series description has certain metadata in common (e.g. title, creator, type of archival materials, level of description, other titles, location, inclusive dates, coverage dates, function and use, scope and content notes, index terms).</p>

	<h2>System Discussion</h2>

	<h3>Unique or Interesting Features</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="point-header">Advanced and Simple Searching — </span>The system supports both basic string search and advanced search capabilities. There are help guides to support the use of both of these search functions. The search functionality can apply to all records, a specific series, or a specific file. Users can switch back and forth between simple and advanced search features in the same interface using the “Basic Search” or “Advanced Search” hyperlinks. The “with all of the values” search bar uses the “AND” operator on the keywords entered, the “with any of the values” search bar uses the “OR” operator on the keywords entered, the “with the exact phrase” search bar searches for the exact phrase that is entered, and the “without values” uses the “NOT” operator on the keywords entered.</li>
		<li><span class="point-header">In-Field Searching – </span>Searching on the level of a file – which can represent an individual database of records –  allows users to search within individual fields that are available for the records in that file. The search page for individual files displays default fields for searching, but a user can choose the “show more fields” option on the file search page to select more fields to add to the search page. Only ten fields from a file can be added to the search page at one time. Users can click into the hyperlink of the field title to view the data type of the field, archival or agency notes about the field, and any additional metadata to aid in their searching. The “with all of the values” (i.e. AND operator), the “with any of the values” (i.e. OR operator), or the “with exact phrase” (i.e. phase searching) search methods can be used to search text fields. After a search is executed for a field-level search, the number of search results is displayed out of the total number of records so the user can determine if they need to refine their search.</li>
		<li><span class="point-header">Code Selection and Validation – </span>When a record field consists of a set of restricted values, users can click the “Select from Code List” link in the “Enter Values” column and select multiple values from a predefined list of options to filter records by. This simplifies searching for users who are not familiar with the codes used by a particular field.</li>
		
	</ul>


	<h3>Pros and Cons of the System</h3>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="point-header">Streamlined Functionality – </span>The function of the website is streamlined. It offers only access to the series, files, and records available and uses the same style of interface for all records. This no-fluff approach appeals to a wide range of audiences and allows users with lower levels of comfort with technology to easily navigate the site once they review the help guides.</li>
					<li><span class="point-header">Feature Documentation – </span>There are various guides available for getting started with the site that can be accessed from any page on the AAD site. The “Getting Started Guide” on the homepage offers an overview of the purpose and history of the site as well as the ways in which archival materials are stored. From any page, users can click the “Help” link at the right hand corner of the screen for context-specific help or click the “AAD TOOLS” link on the left hand corner of the screen to access the full user guide, site term definitions, and a page of frequently asked questions.</li>
					<li><span class="point-header">Robust Searching – </span>This site offers robust simple and advanced searching features at the series, file, record, and field levels as well as a wide variety of predefined subjects for browsing archival materials. This offers users with vague search criteria an opportunity to browse the series offered via the subject headings and use the index terms listed under each series to narrow their search. It also allows users with a more specific search in mind to use the built-in operators in the advanced search bars to target specific items based on their chosen search terms.</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="point-header">Lack of Embedded User Guides – </span>Despite the amount of documentation available for the AAD site, none of these help guides are built into the interface at the “point of need” (i.e. the context where the guidance is needed). The help guides are all compiled on one page that can only be accessed via the “Help” link on the right hand corner of the screen. Although the information contained in the help guide is useful, it renders as a pop out window and is very text heavy and therefore it can be difficult to find the guidance needed, especially if the user has trouble reading small text.</li>
					<li><span class="point-header">Tight and Text-Heavy Interface – </span>The homepage and the individual detail pages for the series and files are text-heavy and this makes each page feel busy and overwhelming. The default text is very small. This text is hard to read on mobile devices and requires users with compromised eyesight to zoom in several times on the page to read link text. The site also makes liberal use of hyperlinks which are very hard to click via a touchscreen without missing the desired target.</li>
					<li><span class="point-header">Hyperlinks Open as New Windows – </span>The AAD site includes many hyperlinks that link to additional information about files, record fields, and page information. These links mostly open in new windows and an attempt to open a second window overwrites the previous window. Right clicking on these hyperlinks and attempting to open them in a new tab or a new window leads to a blank screen. This is very inconvenient for researchers who may be reviewing multiple pieces of information and want to have multiple windows or tabs open at once.</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="point-header">Modern Interface – </span>I do not propose adding additional functionality to the site, only updating what already exists. The interface needs to be updated with a responsive design. The hyperlinks can be replaced with tiles that enable browsing and clicking via a mobile device and some of the longer explanatory text can be placed within tool tips or “show more” buttons that display the text in modals or collapsible containers that can be easily closed with the use of a touchscreen. This will result in a cleaner, more accessible and modern design.</li>
		<li><span class="point-header">Embedded User Guides – </span>Users may get overwhelmed with the current help guide, which is a pop out window containing lengthy text instructions. To keep from overwhelming users with too much text at once, these guides can be moved from the “Help” link to the point of need and embedded in tool tips and help buttons. A user may be confused at how the different search bars in the advanced search feature interpret their input, instead of going to the “Help” link they can have the option of clicking individual help icons for each search bar where they can review a brief explanation of each search functionality.</li>
		<li><span class="point-header">Filtering of Search Results – </span>Currently there are no options to filter search results once a search is executed. Users must return to the search page and perform a new search to refine their results. Because of the amount of records that could be returned for a general search, adding an option for filtering search results by different facets of the records returned will allow for a simplified user experience than having to keep switching back to the search page.</li>
